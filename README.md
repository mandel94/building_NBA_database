# building_NBA_database
The aim of this project is the creation of a database of NBA statistics. 

Statistics are retrieved from the website https://www.basketball-reference.com/. 
This website is a great source of information relating NBA teams, players and seasons over the years. I would like to retrieve that information using web-scraping tools, 
with the objectives of:
1. refactoring  that information to dataframes data structures.
2. organizing the resulting data structures into a relational database. 


Tools: 
  - Beautiful Soup (version 4.9.3) for web-scraping.
  - MySQL (8.0.25 MySQL Community Server) for creating the database.


Programming Languages:
  - Python (version 3.9)
